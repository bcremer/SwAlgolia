Pushing article data to Algolia index
====
To push your article data to the algolia index, run the following command:

* Full index update: `php bin/console swalgoliasync full`

Multiple shops / Multilanguage shops
=====
The SwAlgolia plugin creates one Algolia index for each of your active shops. So if you have two shops (e.g. German and English), 
those shops would generate two indices following this naming convention:

`<prefix>-<shopId>`. 

The prefix can be defined in the plugin config, the shopId is added automatically.

Article attributes
=====
By default *all article attributes* (default and plugin-added) are pushed to Algolia Index. You can block attributes from being
transmitted by adding their names in the plugin configuration under *Blocked article attributes*. Add all attribute names here and 
delimit them with a colon.

Article properties and instant search faceting
=====
All article properties are published to Algolia index by default. If an option is marked as *filterable* it will be automatically added to the filter-sidebar on the instant search page. If you donÂ´t want that a filter is shown there, simply remove the *filterable flag* from the option and recompile your theme.

Glossary
=====
